- Contains subjective language ("most important", "greatest", "according to article")
- Answer cannot be verified as factual cricket information
- Question is about article opinions rather than cricket events
- Facts are inaccurate or misrepresented

QUALITY RANKING (for accepted questions):
A = Excellent factual question with clear cricket event/performance
