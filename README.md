</div>

An intelligent, AI-powered cricket trivia engine that generates engaging, factual questions through advanced web search integration and multi-layer validation. Built with React Native for cross-platform mobile experience and featuring a sophisticated CLI testing framework.

## About

Cricket AI Trivia (CAT) was created by **Sidd Nambiar** out of a passion for cricket and fascination with AI/Data Science projects. This system goes beyond simple question generation by implementing an intelligent pipeline that ensures both quality and quantity through adaptive content discovery and factual validation.

CAT solves the fundamental challenge of creating engaging, accurate cricket trivia at scale. Traditional trivia systems rely on static databases that become stale and repetitive. CAT dynamically discovers cricket content from the web, extracts factual information, and generates contextually rich questions that test genuine cricket knowledge rather than article comprehension.

## What Makes CAT Special

### Intelligent Content Discovery
CAT doesn't just generate random cricket questions. It actively searches for cricket content using 25+ dynamic search patterns, scores articles for cricket relevance, and ensures source diversity to prevent content clustering.

### Factual Validation Framework
The system distinguishes between factual cricket events and subjective opinions. Questions test knowledge of actual cricket history‚Äîscores, dates, performances, results‚Äîrather than what an article "considers" important.

### Guaranteed Quality & Quantity
Through a sophisticated 3x over-generation strategy with A/B/C quality ranking, CAT guarantees the requested number of high-quality questions by generating more than needed and selecting the best.

### AI Processing Pipeline

1. **Search Intelligence**: Generates varied search terms with dramatic modifiers ("legendary moments", "controversial decisions")
2. **Content Discovery**: Adaptively fetches 15-50 articles based on quality and relevance
3. **Fact Extraction**: Identifies concrete cricket events vs. subjective commentary
4. **Multi-Generation**: Creates 3x more questions than needed for better selection
5. **Validation Engine**: AI fact-checker validates against source articles
6. **Quality Ranking**: A/B/C grading system ensures only top-tier questions
7. **Smart Selection**: Automatically selects best questions to guarantee count
